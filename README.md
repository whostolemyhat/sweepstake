#World Cup sweepstake

Web app to track Rockpool's World Cup sweepstake.

Uses Backbone on the frontend and a Node/Express/Mongo stack for the API.

##Installation

Requires Node, NPM and Mongodb to be installed.

Download repo then run `npm install` in the root folder. `npm start` starts the server on port 3000.

Create a database called 'worldcup' in Mongo (or edit the connection string). I use Robomongo as a GUI on Windows.
